# ControlHub / ControlLab – Repository Guide

This document explains **how to use the ControlHub repository in practice**:
- where each type of file belongs,
- what each folder is for,
- how to think about projects vs. knowledge vs. planning.

The goal of this structure is to support **learning, experimentation, robotics/mechatronics projects, TDK work, and long-term growth**.

---

## Core principle – how to decide where something goes

Always ask yourself these three questions:

1. **Is this about planning, decisions, or high-level thinking?**  
   → `00_Admin`

2. **Is this a concrete project I want to build or implement?**  
   → `01_Projects`

3. **Is this theory, learning material, or general knowledge?**  
   → `02_Knowledge`

If you follow these rules, the repository will stay clean and scalable.

---

## Root files

### `README.md`
The entry point of the repository.

Contains:
- what ControlHub / ControlLab is,
- what you use it for (learning, robotics, TDK, experiments),
- main technologies (ROS, ESP32, CAD, control theory, etc.).

---

### `.gitignore`
Everything that should **not** be uploaded to GitHub:
- build folders
- cache files
- temporary files
- large autogenerated binaries

---

## 00_Admin – Planning & decisions

This folder is **not for projects**, but for how you think and plan.

### `Roadmap.md`
- short-, mid-, and long-term plans
- skills you want to learn
- systems you want to build

### `Goals.md`
- concrete, measurable goals  
  (e.g. *“Implement a PID controller on ESP32”*, not *“Learn robotics”*)

### `Design_Philosophy.md`
- how you approach engineering
- principles like modularity, documentation, testing

### `Decisions_Log.md`
- log of important technical decisions
- why one solution was chosen over another  
  (very useful for TDK and competitions)

### `Ideas_Backlog.md`
- raw ideas that are **not projects yet**
- future projects usually start here

---

## 01_Projects – Concrete projects

Everything here is something you actively want to build.

### `_Project_Template/`
This is a **template only**.  
Never work directly inside it.

When starting a new project:
1. Copy this folder
2. Rename it (e.g. `Line_Follower_Robot`)
3. Work inside the new folder

---

### Typical project structure

#### `README.md`
- project goal
- what the system does
- required hardware and software

---

### `Docs/`
All written documentation:
- `Concept.md` – core idea
- `Requirements.md` – functional and technical requirements
- `Design_Decisions.md` – why certain solutions were chosen
- `Test_Results.md` – measurements and test outcomes
- `Notes.md` – thoughts, problems, observations

---

### `CAD/`
- `Source/` – editable CAD files (e.g. FreeCAD `.FCStd`)
- `Exports/` – STL / STEP files for manufacturing or sharing
- `Renders/` – images for documentation or presentations

---

### `Electronics/`
- `Schematics/` – circuit diagrams
- `PCB/` – PCB layouts
- `BOM.md` – bill of materials

---

### `Firmware/`
Microcontroller code:
- Arduino
- ESP32 (PlatformIO recommended)

---

### `Software/`
Higher-level or PC-side software:
- `Control/` – control algorithms
- `Vision/` – OpenCV, image processing
- `Utils/` – helper scripts and tools

---

### `ROS/`
- ROS1 and/or ROS2 workspaces
- nodes, launch files, configs

---

### `Simulation/`
Simulation environments:
- Gazebo
- PyBullet
- MATLAB / Simulink

---

### `Assets/`
Project-specific images, videos, and diagrams.

---

## 02_Knowledge – Knowledge base

This is **not project-specific**.

Used for:
- control theory notes
- robotics fundamentals
- ROS explanations
- electronics theory
- CAD and simulation notes
- programming concepts

All stored as Markdown, version-controlled with Git.

---

## 03_Templates – Reusable templates

Reusable documents:
- project README templates
- design decision templates
- test report templates
- experiment logs

These help keep documentation consistent and fast.

---

## 04_Assets – Global media

Non-project-specific media:
- diagrams
- images
- videos

Used across multiple projects or documents.

---

## 05_Tools – Helper tools

- scripts
- Docker setups
- environment and setup guides

---

## Recommended workflow

- VS Code for coding and Markdown documentation
- Git for version control
- PlatformIO for firmware development
- One repository = one complete digital lab

This structure is **scalable**:  
perfect for learning now, and strong enough for serious projects, TDK work, and competitions later.
