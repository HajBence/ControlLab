# Ultrasonic Distance Meter

A simple but well-documented ultrasonic distance measurement system
based on a microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32).

The project focuses on:
- accurate distance measurement,
- clean firmware structure,
- proper documentation,
- extendability toward robotics applications.

This project serves as the first reference implementation
in the ControlHub lab.
